Let's assume your monthly income were to somehow double.
Vamos assumir que sua renda mensal de alguma maneira dobrasse.

Congratulations!
Parabéns

You can now, for the most part, afford to buy two times more stuff. But
Agora você pode, em geral, comprar duas vezes mais coisas. Mas

what if the monthly income of everyone else were to also double?

Well, in that case, youd'd no longer be able to buy 2 times more stuff,
because since everyone else also erans 2 times more, there would be 2
more money chasing roughy the same number of goods. Let's take things
one step further.

What if tour income doubles but the income of everyone else triples?
In that case, you'd actually become poor. Why? Because making 2 times
more money is not enough to keep up with everyone else, who now makes
3 times more.

If there is an overall increase in te price of goods and services of x%
this year, you have to earn at least x% more than last year to avoid
becoming poor in real terms. History makes the effects of inflatio crystal
clear.

Today, each dollar buys you approximately 39 times less potatoes than 100
years ago. Or 20 times less coffee, 24 times less bread, and so on.
